Hi, I'm Matt. I'm a software engineer from London. 

#### About this site

This site has existed in some form or another under various domain names since about 2005, when I was gifted a book called _HTML for Dummies_ (now, unsurprisingly, [out of print](https://www.dummies.com/store/product/HTML-4-For-Dummies-5th-Edition.productCd-0764589172.html)) and was inspired to create my own site.

Unfortunately, most of my old blog posts have been lost as this site has undergone redesigns over the years. I do intend to migrate some of the archived content when I get a chance.
